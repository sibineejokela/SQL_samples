### SQL Samples

This repository contains two slide decks that use SQL to address company inquiries. The data analyzed for this project was fictional.
1. The Codeflix slide deck looks at __user churn__ between segments for different months.
2. The WP slide deck explores __marketing funnels__ and an __A/B test__ for two user groups.

To view the slide decks, click the "All_Slides.." markdown file from within each folder. 
You can also download the slide decks from within the folders.
